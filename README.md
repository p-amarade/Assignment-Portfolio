# Assignment-Portfolio
This repository showcases the codes of my assignments for my master of data science.
 
# Unit List
## FIT5201 - Machine learning
### Assignment 1 
This assignment let me understand model complexity, model selection, uncertainty in prediction with bootstrapping, probabilistic machine learning, and linear models for regression and classification by implementing various models without using some of the libraries. I also learnt the effect of the number of K in KNNregressor and K-fold in cross-validation. Lastly, I tap into the impact of L2-regularization by observing training and testing errors.
### Assignment 2 
I comprehend the difference between Perception and Neural Networks by plotting the decision boundary and the effect of k values on testing accuracy between them.

## FIT5202 - Data processing for big data 
### Assignment 1 
In this assignment, I have to implement various solutions based on RDDs and DataFrames in PySpark for the given queries related to trip data analysis.
### Assignment 2A 
I have to prepare the data, perform data exploration and extract features, and build and persist the machine learning models by implementing the solutions using PySpark SQL / MLlib / ML packages. For the data visualisations, please use Matplotlib packages to prepare the plots.
### Assignment 2B 
This assignment has three main tasks, which are producing streaming data, processing the streaming data, and visualising the data by using Pandas, PySpark ML / DataFrame  and read
the data from the Kafka stream.

## FIT5120 - Industry experience studio project
As a Data Analyst for the project at Monash University capstone unit, my primary responsibility comprises finding and providing high-quality data for the team and recommending ideas for a project while working in an agile environment. On the technical side, I mainly do data wrangling, such as combining the dataset from various PDF files into one dataset or combining multiple CSV files. I must also extract only the required data to make the frontend developer. I also do the draft data visualisation in Tableau.

This project won the Monash Post Graduate Industry Experience(IE) Expo on "Quality Education."

## FIT5147 - Data exploration and visualisation
I learned how to check for missing, invalid, or duplicate data in this unit using Tableau. I also do the data visualisation in Tableau in various ways. For this assignment, I have to make the visualisation to compare each location's average solar energy generation and show the total energy generated. 

## FIT5152 - User interface design and usability
I learned how to design effectively in this unit by understanding user interaction design theories, principles and practices and usability for web-based systems and small-screen devices. I also found this valuable unit in data visualisation and the final project.
For the assignment, I designed the application HobbyHive, an online learning application with a target audience of young adults.

## FIT5196 - Data wrangling
### Assignment 1 
The main task for this assignment is Data Cleansing in Python to fix errors, remove outliers and impute the missing values in different datasets using Pandas.
### Assignment 2 
This assignment allowed me to learn how to do web scraping by using the Beautiful Soup library on https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au and do the data integration from several sources into one dataset with a specific schema.

## FIT9136 - Algorithms and programming foundations in Python
As a foundation unit, I learned how to write Python for the first time in this unit. I include assignments such as password generator, returning home program, and chess game reading. visualisation the data
